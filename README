These are some tools I've found helpful to churn through Wikipedia.

The wp-words-to-db will run through the xml of a pages-articles.xml.bz2 dump.
The meta-to-page-linewise will take a pages-meta-historz.xml.7z and produce a (page, revision, page, revision) set of xml shard quadruples.
The page-linewise-to-inserts will then make insert statements for revisions with diff-sizes.
